## Content Review Process

Since the initial drafts of the chapters are generated by AI, we have a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) process to ensure quality.

1.  **AI Generation**: A chapter is generated from a `spec.md` file.
2.  **Initial Review**: The generated Markdown file is reviewed for basic structure and formatting.
3.  **Technical Review**: A subject matter expert reviews the content for technical accuracy. Any errors or unclear explanations are corrected.
4.  **Copy Editing**: The chapter is reviewed for grammar, spelling, and style.
5.  **Final Approval**: The chapter is approved and merged.
